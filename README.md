## 🚀 Overview

**WebbiOS** is an open-source, edge-native operating system for modern web development built entirely on **Cloudflare**. It provides a foundational architecture to rapidly develop, deploy, and scale websites, headless commerce storefronts, and internal tools with zero infrastructure management.

By leveraging Cloudflare's massive global network, WebbiOS delivers **sub-50ms Time To First Byte (TTFB)** worldwide and is designed to operate at scale for $0 on Cloudflare's Free Tier.

## 🏗️ Architecture

WebbiOS is architected as a **Monorepo** (managed by `pnpm` and `Turborepo`) and follows a Micro-Frontend & Serverless microservices design pattern.

### Core Layers
1. **Core Kernel (Layer 1)**: The central nervous system of WebbiOS.
   - **`@webbios/api`**: A blazing-fast Cloudflare Worker built with [Hono](https://hono.dev/). Handles routing, authentication, RBAC, and business logic.
   - **`@webbios/db`**: Database ORM layer powered by [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), interacting natively with Cloudflare D1.
2. **Web Foundation (Layer 2)**: The UI & App ecosystem.
   - **`@webbios/dashboard`**: A Micro-Frontend dashboard built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.
   - **`@webbios/storefront-engine`**: An edge-rendering storefront worker utilizing React 19 Server Streaming (`renderToReadableStream`) to render JSON-driven UI themes at the edge.
   - **`@webbios/storefront-ui`**: The component library for building modern, dark-mode optimized themes.
   - **`@webbios/ui`**: Internal UI components for the dashboard.
3. **Application SDKs**: 
   - **`@webbios/sdk`**: Strongly typed TypeScript SDK to interact with WebbiOS core services.

### Technologies
- **Compute**: Cloudflare Workers
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- **Object Storage**: Cloudflare R2
- **Caching**: Cloudflare KV & Worker Cache API
- **Frameworks**: React 19, Vite, Hono, Tailwind CSS
- **Tooling**: TypeScript, pnpm, Turborepo

## ✨ Key Features

- **Edge Native**: 100% serverless, zero cold starts, deployed to 300+ cities globally.
- **Micro-Frontend Architecture**: Dynamically load applications inside the dashboard via Module Federation.
- **Universal Storefront Engine**: JSON-driven theme rendering using Edge SSR and streaming.
- **4-Tier Caching**: Advanced caching strategy (CDN -> Worker Cache -> KV -> D1) for maximum performance.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained permissions for users, API keys, and apps.
- **Zero Cost to Start**: Designed to run entirely within Cloudflare's generous free tier.
